=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functionality to preprocess and wrap arguments
that would normally go to gcc. After processing the arguments, it calls
nvcc, nVidia's compiler wrapper, supplying the same arguments in a way
that nvcc can digest them.

To use this, the basic recipe involves replacing the compiler and
linker options with the strings C<"$^X -MExtUtils::nvcc -ecompile">
and C<"$^X -MExtUtils::nvcc -elink">, respectively.

The library provides a number of functions, but only exports C<compile>
and C<link>, which go through the argument list and call other library
functions to process what they see.

=head2 Inline

=cut

sub Inline {
	return CC => "$^X -MExtUtils::nvcc -eExtUtils::nvcc::compiler --"
        , LD => "$^X -MExtUtils::nvcc -eExtUtils::nvcc::linker --";
}

=head2 EUMM

=cut

sub EUMM {
	return CC => "$^X -MExtUtils::nvcc -eExtUtils::nvcc::compiler --"
        , LD => "$^X -MExtUtils::nvcc -eExtUtils::nvcc::linker --";
}

=head2 MB

=cut

sub MB {
	return cc => "$^X -MExtUtils::nvcc -eExtUtils::nvcc::compiler --",
                ld => "$^X -MExtUtils::nvcc -eExtUtils::nvcc::linker --"	
} 


=head2 compiler

The compiler function processes all arguments in C<@ARGS>, ensures that
the source file ends in a .cu extension, and invokes nvcc as a compiler.

nvcc's behavior depends on the filename's ending (can't set it with a flag, as
far as I can tell), so filenames with CUDA code must have a .cu ending. However,
the Inline::C and pretty much any utility that creates XS extensions for Perl)
sends files with a .c file extension to the compiler. To make
this work as a drop-in replacement for gcc in Inline::C, this needs to send .cu
files to nvcc whenever it encounters .c files.

The way this is actually implemented, C<ExtUtils::nvcc> first tries to create a symbolic
link to the .c file with the .cu extension; it then tries a hard link; it last
tries a direct copy. If none of these work, perl_nvcc croaks. In particular, you
will encounter trouble if you try to compile a .c file and you
have an identically named .cu file.

The linker function processes all arguments in C<@ARGS>, and invokes nvcc
as a linker with properly modified arguments.

	# finish with death if nvcc failed:
	die $@ if $@;
}

=head2 run_nvcc

Runs nvcc with the supplied list of nvcc-compatible command-line arguments,
using the L<system> Perl function.

If the system call fails, run_nvcc checks that it can find nvcc in the first
place, and croaks with one of two messages:

=over

=item nvcc encountered a problem

This message means that nvcc is in your path but the system call failed, which
means that the compile didn't like what you sent it.

=item Unable to run nvcc. Is it in your path?

This message means that nvcc cannot be found. Make sure you've installed nVidia's
toolkit and double-check your path settings.

=back

To use, try something like this:

 eval {run_nvcc qw(my_source.cu -o my_program)};
 
 # Die if there was an error:
 die $@ if $@;

#				: or is not available

		# If nvcc is available, it must be compiler error:
		die "nvcc encountered a problem\n";
	}
}

=head2 process_args

Processes the list of supplied (gcc-style) arguments, seperating out 
nvcc-compatible arguments, and nvcc-incompatible arguments, and source file
names. The resulting lists are returned by reference in that order.

Here's a usage example:

 # Get the nvcc args, the compiler args, and the source files:
 my ($nvcc_args, $other_args, $source_files) = process_args(@ARGV);
 
 # Unpack array refs into normal arrays
 my @nvcc_args = @$nvcc_args;
 my @other_args = @$other_args;
 my @source_files = @$source_files;

################################################################################
# Usage			: ($nvcc_args, $other_args, $files) = process_args(@array)
# Purpose		: Process the command-line arguments, seperating out the nvcc-
#				: compatible options from the source file names and the other
#				: compiler options.
# Returns		: Three array references containing
#				:	- nvcc args
#				:	- other args
#				:	- file names
# Parameters	: The array of command-line options to be processed.
# Throws		: if the last argument was expecting a value, such as -o file.o
#				: but without the file.o bit.
# Comments		: The means by which this function performs its work is hackish,
#				: but I doubt it needs to be improved except possibly for
#				: legibility. Perhaps all of these options can be seperated into
#				: some text file, or put in the __DATA__ section, in more readable
#				: form and then parsed once upon loading?

=head2 make_cu_file

Takes a C source file with a .c extension and makes an associated .cu file. Sure,
I could just copy the contents of the file, or temporarily rename the source
file, but I decided to first try making a symbolic link or hard link before
resorting to copying.

As it turns out, the command to copy a file takes different arguments from the
command to create a symbolic link, so one purpose of this function is to
encapsulate the annoyance that is those differences.

=cut

################################################################################
# Usage			: make_cu_file($c_file_name)
# Purpose		: Create a like-named file with a .cu extension, either by
#				: creating a symbolic link, a hard link, or a direct copy.
# Returns		: nothing
# Parameters	: $c_file_name, a string with the c file name,
#				: with the .c extension
# Throws		: when unable to create the .cu file, usually when such
#				: a file already exists.
# Comments		: The way that link and symlink handle relative file paths
#				: differs from the way that copy handles relative file paths.
#				: Relative paths are computed with respect to the SECOND
#				: ARGUMENT'S LOCATION, rather than the present working directory.
#				: In other words, if you're making a link, but you're not working
#				: in the directory where the link resides, you have to do some
#				: file name munging. This is particularly annoying, since plain
#				: old copies DON'T behave this way. The purpose of this function
#				: is to encapsulate that annoying edge case.
# See also		: compiler

sub make_cu_file {

	# Try a hard link:
